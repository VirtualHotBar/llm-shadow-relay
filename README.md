# LLM Shadow Relay

An audited LLM API proxy that sits between your clients and LLM providers. It intercepts requests/responses and audits them with a trusted model to detect prompt injection, system prompt extraction, jailbreak attempts, and other security risks — before they reach your application.

## Features

- **Dual protocol support** — Accept both OpenAI (`/v1/chat/completions`) and Anthropic (`/v1/messages`) client formats, and forward to either protocol upstream
- **Automatic protocol conversion** — Client talks OpenAI? Upstream talks Anthropic? No problem. The proxy transparently converts between formats.
- **Named upstream agents** — Route requests to explicit provider/model profiles with `/v1/agents/{agent_id}/...`
- **Request-side + response-side auditing** — Audits incoming prompts for injection attempts AND outgoing responses for leaked data or malicious content
- **Dual audit mode**: `sync` (blocking — waits for audit before responding) or `async` (non-blocking — returns immediately, audits in background)
- **Streaming support** — SSE streaming with real-time chunk-level audit
- **Configurable policy engine** — Block by risk level, category, custom keywords, or risk score threshold
- **Provider-flexible audit** — Audit via OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, Ollama, or any local model
- **Multi-agent audit quorum** — Run optional secondary audit agents in parallel and enforce the strictest decision
- **Audit metadata headers** — Risk level and score returned in response headers (sync mode)
- **Request correlation** — Propagates or generates `x-request-id` for logs and responses

## Quick Start

### 1. Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The binary is `target/release/llm-shadow-relay.exe` (Windows) or `target/release/llm-shadow-relay` (Linux/macOS).

### 2. Configure

Copy `config.example.toml` to `config.toml` and edit:

```toml
[upstream]
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-your-upstream-key"
default_model = "gpt-4o"
protocol = "openai"          # "openai" or "anthropic"

[audit]
provider = "openai"          # "openai", "anthropic", "ollama", "local"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-your-audit-key"
model = "gpt-4o-mini"
enabled = true
mode = "sync"                # "sync" or "async"

[[audit.agents]]
name = "strict-local-reviewer"
provider = "ollama"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
model = "qwen2.5-8b"
```

Optional named upstream agents:

```toml
[[agents]]
id = "research"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-your-research-key"
default_model = "gpt-4o"
protocol = "openai"

[[agents]]
id = "writer"
base_url = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-ant-your-writer-key"
default_model = "claude-3-haiku-20240307"
protocol = "anthropic"
```

### 3. Run

```bash
./target/release/llm-shadow-relay
# → Listening on 127.0.0.1:8080
```

### 4. Use

**Web UI:**
Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/ui` in your browser to inspect health, compose requests, choose configured named agents, and view responses. The UI reads `/ui/config` for a redacted summary of protocol, default model, header passthrough, and agent ids; API keys are not exposed.
The Web UI supports English and Chinese labels, with an auto mode that follows the browser language. Manual language choice is stored locally in the browser.
Use **Preview** to inspect the final request URL, body, and redacted headers before sending. After a request, the metadata panel shows redacted request and response headers alongside status, latency, request id, and audit headers.
Long-running requests can be cancelled with **Abort**, and response output can be copied directly from the response toolbar.
The UI keeps a short in-memory request history for quick replay and cURL copy; history is cleared when the page is reloaded.

**OpenAI client:**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

**Named upstream agent:**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/agents/research/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Summarize this paper"}]}'
```

**Anthropic client:**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-3","max_tokens":1024,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

**Named Anthropic-style upstream agent:**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/agents/writer/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"","max_tokens":1024,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Draft a release note"}]}'
```

## Configuration Reference

### `[server]`

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `listen` | `"127.0.0.1:8080"` | Server binding address |
| `timeout` | `300` | Request timeout in seconds |
| `max_request_mb` | `10` | Maximum request body size in MB |

### `[upstream]`

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `base_url` | — | Upstream API base URL (e.g. `https://api.openai.com/v1`) |
| `api_key` | — | Upstream API key (can also use env var `LLM_SHADOW_RELAY_UPSTREAM_API_KEY`); leave empty to pass through client auth |
| `default_model` | — | Default model when not specified in request |
| `protocol` | `"openai"` | Upstream protocol: `"openai"` or `"anthropic"` |
| `extra_headers` | `{}` | Additional HTTP headers sent to upstream |
| `pass_through_headers` | `true` | Pass safe client headers such as `x-*`, `anthropic-*`, `openai-organization`, `openai-project`, `user-agent`, and `accept-language` |
| `timeout` | — | Upstream timeout in seconds (defaults to `server.timeout`) |
| `max_retries` | `2` | Retries for transient upstream failures: 429, 500, 502, 503, 504, timeout, connect |
| `retry_initial_ms` | `250` | Initial exponential backoff delay |
| `retry_max_ms` | `5000` | Maximum retry delay; also caps `Retry-After` |

When `api_key` is empty, the relay forwards client auth to upstream. OpenAI upstreams receive the inbound `Authorization` header. Anthropic upstreams receive inbound `x-api-key`; if that is missing, `Authorization: Bearer ...` is converted to `x-api-key`.

Header passthrough deliberately excludes hop-by-hop headers, `host`, `content-length`, `content-type`, `accept`, `authorization`, and `x-api-key`; those are managed by the relay or protocol adapter.

Upstream retries are only attempted before a response body is returned to the client. For 429 responses with `Retry-After` in seconds, that value is honored up to `retry_max_ms`; otherwise the relay uses exponential backoff.

Streaming audit blocks and upstream stream parse failures are emitted as SSE `event: error` messages with a JSON `{ "error": ... }` payload.

The relay propagates inbound `x-request-id` values and returns them on every response. If the client does not send one, the relay generates a UUID request id.

### `[[agents]]`

Named upstream agents are optional. They use the same connection fields as `[upstream]`, plus a required unique non-empty `id`, and are selected only through explicit routes:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/v1/agents/{agent_id}/chat/completions` | OpenAI-compatible client request routed to a named upstream agent |
| `/v1/agents/{agent_id}/messages` | Anthropic-compatible client request routed to a named upstream agent |

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | — | Stable route id for the upstream agent |
| `base_url` | — | Upstream API base URL |
| `api_key` | — | Agent-specific upstream API key; leave empty to pass through client auth |
| `default_model` | — | Default model when request `model` is empty |
| `protocol` | `"openai"` | Upstream protocol: `"openai"` or `"anthropic"` |
| `extra_headers` | `{}` | Agent-specific extra headers |
| `pass_through_headers` | `true` | Agent-specific client header passthrough |
| `timeout` | — | Agent-specific upstream timeout in seconds |
| `max_retries` | `2` | Agent-specific retry attempts |
| `retry_initial_ms` | `250` | Agent-specific initial retry delay |
| `retry_max_ms` | `5000` | Agent-specific maximum retry delay |

### `[audit]`

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | — | Audit model provider: `"openai"`, `"anthropic"`, `"ollama"`, `"local"` |
| `base_url` | — | Audit API base URL (for non-OpenAI providers) |
| `api_key` | — | Audit API key (env var: `LLM_SHADOW_RELAY_AUDIT_API_KEY`) |
| `model` | — | Audit model name (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`, `claude-3-haiku`, `qwen2.5-8b`) |
| `temperature` | `0.1` | Lower = more consistent audit decisions |
| `max_tokens` | `2048` | Max tokens for audit response |
| `enabled` | `true` | Enable/disable audit |
| `stream_audit` | `true` | Audit streaming chunks in real-time |
| `batch_size` | `10` | Chunks to accumulate before streaming audit |
| `mode` | `"sync"` | `"sync"` (blocking) or `"async"` (background) |
| `system_prompt` | — | Custom audit system prompt |
| `agents` | `[]` | Optional secondary audit agents; each inherits missing fields from `[audit]` |

### `[[audit.agents]]`

Secondary audit agents run in parallel with the primary audit model. The relay enforces the strictest successful decision. If the primary audit model fails, the request fails as before; if a secondary agent fails, the failure is logged and the remaining successful decisions are used.

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | `"audit-agent-N"` | Human-readable name for logs |
| `provider` | `[audit].provider` | `"openai"`, `"anthropic"`, `"ollama"`, or `"local"` |
| `base_url` | `[audit].base_url` | Agent-specific audit API base URL |
| `api_key` | `[audit].api_key` | Agent-specific API key |
| `model` | `[audit].model` | Agent-specific model |
| `temperature` | `[audit].temperature` | Agent-specific temperature |
| `max_tokens` | `[audit].max_tokens` | Agent-specific max tokens |
| `system_prompt` | `[audit].system_prompt` | Agent-specific audit system prompt |

### `[policy]`

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `block_risk_levels` | `["critical", "high"]` | Risk levels that block the request |
| `block_prompt_injection` | `true` | Block on prompt injection detection |
| `block_system_prompt_extraction` | `true` | Block on system prompt extraction |
| `block_tool_call` | `true` | Block on tool call injection |
| `log_all` | `true` | Log all audit decisions |
| `custom_keywords` | `[]` | Extra keywords to flag |

## Audit Logic

1. **Pre-request audit**: User's prompt is checked for injection patterns **before** forwarding to upstream
2. **Response audit**: The upstream response is analyzed by the audit model for security risks
3. **Policy enforcement**: Audit decisions are evaluated against configurable policy rules
4. **Sync mode**: Client waits for full audit before receiving response
5. **Async mode**: Response is returned immediately; audit runs in background (logged only)

## Protocol Conversion

The proxy uses OpenAI-style `ChatCompletionRequest`/`ChatCompletionResponse` as its **internal canonical format**:

| Client Sends | Upstream Protocol | What Happens |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| OpenAI | OpenAI | Direct passthrough |
| OpenAI | Anthropic | Convert → send to `/messages` → convert response back |
| Anthropic | OpenAI | Convert to canonical → send → convert to Anthropic |
| Anthropic | Anthropic | Convert → send → convert back (round-trip) |

This ensures the audit engine always works with the same canonical format regardless of the client or upstream protocol.

## Security Considerations

- The **audit model** should be a **trusted** model — this is your security checkpoint
- Recommended audit models: `gpt-4o-mini`, `claude-3-haiku`, `deepseek-chat`, `qwen2.5-8b`
- The upstream model is treated as **untrusted** — that's why we audit it
- API keys can be set via environment variables to avoid committing secrets:
  - `LLM_SHADOW_RELAY_UPSTREAM_API_KEY`
  - `LLM_SHADOW_RELAY_AUDIT_API_KEY`
- In `async` mode, audit failures are logged but not returned to the client — monitor your logs!
